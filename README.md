# Motor Learning Teaching Tools

Welcome! This repository is a collection of interactive teaching tools and resources designed for motor learning education, blending hands-on skill acquisition with modern technology and AI.

## About Me

I am a PhD student at the [HABIT Lab](https://www.utas.edu.au/research/groups/habit), where I am researching and developing an objective measurement for sedentary behaviour.

I am leading the development of an e-health solution, [Exertime](https://www.exertime.com/), designed to promote healthier desk-based workplaces.

I am beginning my teaching journey as a tutor in motor learning, aiming to assist students in understanding and improving motor skills‚Äînot merely through practice, but with the support of planning, assessment, and evaluation. My background in technology allows me to bring a distinctive approach to the classroom. In addition to tutoring, I am collaborating with [Coginiti](https://cogniti.ai/), an AI agent developed by educators from the University of Sydney.

### Interactive Motor Learning Tools

*   **Constant Error ùë•ÃÑ, Absolute Error |ùë•ÃÑ|, and Variable Error:** The [Constant Error Tool](./Constant%20Error%20Tool.html) provides an interactive platform for students to learn and measure key concepts in motor performance using a dartboard game. These concepts are visualised and calculated live as students "throw darts" on the digital dartboard.
*   **Privacy-Preserving, Local AI:** To protect student privacy, the tool applies the [Prompt API](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/prompt-api), enabling a local LLM (Large Language Model) directly in the browser. This allows for personalised, context-aware guidance based on each student's dartboard performance while ensuring that no data leaves their device.

#### How to Use

The core of these interactive tools employs HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. You can simply download the HTML file and open it in your local web browser‚Äîno installation is required. The tools may also be embedded into online learning modules for wider access.

If using the local and offline AI chatbot features, your browser must meet the requirements outlined at the [Chrome Prompt API documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/prompt-api). This ensures privacy-preserving, on-device AI capabilities.

### Prompts for AI

This repository contains prompt examples and templates used for AI-powered teaching. These prompts are designed to encourage critical thinking and deeper understanding and can be applied on platforms supporting AI chat (such as Coginiti).
