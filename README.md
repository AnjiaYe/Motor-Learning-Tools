# Motor Learning Teaching Tools

Welcome!
This repository is a collection of interactive teaching tools and resources designed for motor learning education, blending hands-on skill acquisition with modern technology and AI.

## About Me

I'm a PhD student@[HABIT Lab](https://www.utas.edu.au/research/groups/habit).

I'm leading the development of an e-health solution - [Exertime](https://www.exertime.com/).

I'm starting my teaching journey as a tutor in motor learning, aiming to help students understand and improve motor skills‚Äînot just through practice, but with the support of planning, assessment and evaluation. My background in technology lets me bring a my approach to the classroom. In addition to tutoring, I am also collaborating with [Coginiti](https://cogniti.ai/), an AI agent developed by educators from the University of Sydney.

### Interactive Motor Learning Tools

*   **Constant Error ùë•ÃÑ, Absolute Error |ùë•ÃÑ|, and Variable Error:** The [Constant Error Tool](./Constant%20Error%20Tool.html) provides an interactive platform for students to learn and measure key concepts in motor performance using a dartboard game. These concepts are visualized and calculated live as students "throw darts" on the digital dartboard.
*   **Privacy-Preserving, Local AI:** To protect student privacy, the tool applies [Prompt API](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/prompt-api), enabling local LLM (Large Language Model) directly in the browser. This allows for personalized, context-aware guidance based on each student's dartboard performance without data leaving their device.

#### How to Use

The core of these interactive tools uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. You can simply download the HTML file and open it in your local web browser‚Äîno installation required. The tools may also be embedded into online learning modules for wider access.

If using the local and offline AI chatbot features, your browser must meet the requirements outlined at [Chrome Prompt API documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/prompt-api). This ensures privacy-preserving, on-device AI capabilities.

### Prompts for AI

This repo contains prompt examples and templates used for AI-powered teaching. These prompts are designed to encourage critical thinking and deeper understanding, and can be used with platforms supporting AI chat (such as Coginiti).
